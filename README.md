write for a living and see that you share our enthusiasm for code quality.
We value maintainability, elegance and clarity over individual presentations excellence.

The end result of the assignment must contain source code for
the application and unit tests.

If you are unable to finish the whole assignment then write down the problems you
ran into so that we can discuss about them.
